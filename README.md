# Reverse Bus Map เมล์ไปไหนได้บ้าง

A typical bus map application usually focuses on busses or where a bus can go. This map adds a simple twist of finding all bus routes passing through a bus stop (and its neighbors via Voronoi tessellation) instead. It supports zooming and Voronoi hovering for more information.

Bangkok bus data is from a project with Mayday for TEDxBangkok around 2007-2008. The data has not been updated to reflect the most recent and dramatic changes to all bus lines in Bangkok in 2024-2025.
